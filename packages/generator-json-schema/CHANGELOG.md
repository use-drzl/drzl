### Minor Changes

- dc13c47: Add a JSON Schema and OpenAPI generator, and fix two analyzer gaps it uncovered on drizzle-orm 0.4x

  `{ kind: 'json-schema' }` emits plain JSON Schema per table, with no runtime dependency at all.
  The other four generators each target one validation library, so the output only helps a
  TypeScript program that installs that library. JSON Schema is what OpenAPI documents, API
  gateways, form builders and validators in other languages already read, and nothing in the
  official Drizzle family emits it.

  `target` picks the dialect: `draft-2020-12` (default), `openapi-3.1`, or `openapi-3.0`. The last
  is genuinely different rather than older, spelling nullable as `nullable: true` and an exclusive
  bound as a boolean beside the bound. Since JSON Schema ignores unknown keywords rather than
  rejecting them, emitting the wrong dialect gives a document that validates and then accepts what
  the constraint exists to reject.

  Running the new generator through the real CLI surfaced two analyzer bugs affecting **every**
  generator on drizzle-orm 0.4x, the version the analyzer depends on:

  - **`.array()` columns came back `unknown`.** 0.4x wraps the column in a `PgArray` whose
    `baseColumn` is the element; v1 leaves the class alone and raises `dimensions`. Only the v1
    signal was read.
  - **`pgEnum` columns came back `unknown`, on both majors.** The class map had no arm for
    `PgEnumColumn` and `describeV1Column` does not read `dataType: 'string enum'` either. The
    emitted schemas were still correct, because every generator reads `enumValues` ahead of
    `tsType`, so this one was a gap in the analysis model rather than a validation hole.

  The array bug did produce schemas that accepted anything, in all five generators, with nothing
  reporting a problem. `verify-packed.sh` pins `drizzle-orm@1.0.0-rc.4`, so the whole verification
  ladder only ever ran on one major; it now runs a stage against 0.4x that fails on any column the
  analyzer cannot name. That stage found the enum gap the first time it ran.
