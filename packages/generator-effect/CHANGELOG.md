- 1218361: Read three more CHECK shapes: a disjunction that pins one column, `IS NOT NULL`, and the null
  guard in front of a predicate

  `parseCheck` refused every expression holding `OR` and every expression holding `NOT`, which took
  `col IS NOT NULL` with it. Three of those refusals are now readings, one is unchanged, and one that
  used to be a generic "not a comparison" now says what it found.

  ```ts
  // check('status_valid', sql`${t.status} = 'draft' OR ${t.status} = 'live'`)
  status: z.enum(['draft', 'live'] as const).nullable(),

  // check('email_set', sql`${t.email} IS NOT NULL`)   // on a nullable column
  email: z.string(),

  // check('age_adult', sql`${t.age} IS NULL OR ${t.age} >= 18`)
  age: z.number().int().gte(18).lte(2147483647).nullable(),

  // check('tier_ok', sql`${t.tier} IS DISTINCT FROM 'banned'`)
  tier: z.string().refine((v) => v !== 'banned', { message: "tier_ok: tier <> 'banned'" }).nullable(),
  ```

  All five validator generators and the JSON Schema generator, plus `drzl doctor` and the constraint
  ledger.

  **Why a disjunction was refused, and what changed.** A conjunction splits because every part is
  independently _necessary_. A disjunction is the opposite: `CHECK (a OR b)` is satisfied by a row
  that breaks `a`, so a schema enforcing `a` refuses rows the database takes. Nothing about that
  argument has weakened. What is read is the one shape where the _whole_ disjunction is a single
  statement: every branch pinning the same column to a literal, by `=` or by `IN`. `s = 'a' OR
s = 'b'` and `s IN ('a','b')` are the same statement in SQL, NULL included, so they emit the same
  schema. Everything else is refused **whole**, never in part, and named:

  | Refused                     | Reason reported                                 |
  | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
  | `n < 0 OR n > 100`          | a branch is a range rather than a set of values |
  | `a = 'x' OR b = 'y'`        | the branches constrain different columns (a, b) |
  | `s = 'a' OR s = 1`          | the branches mix a string and a number          |
  | `s = 'a' OR lower(s) = 'b'` | part of an OR was not understood                |

  **`IS NOT NULL` narrows the field rather than adding a predicate.** Every other CHECK is emitted
  _inside_ the nullable wrapper, precisely so `null` skips it, which is what makes them match SQL.
  This one is the statement that `null` is not allowed, so it is said by the field not being
  nullable. Applied once, in the three column selectors every generator already calls, so no
  generator learns a new kind of check and none of the six can disagree with the others. On insert
  the field becomes required, because a row omitting a nullable column with no default writes NULL;
  a column that defaults to a value stays optional. On a column already `.notNull()` it changes
  nothing and stops being reported as declined.

  **A null guard reduces away.** `col IS NULL OR P` states nothing beyond `P`, because a CHECK
  already passes on NULL and every operator here yields NULL when its column is NULL. Sound only when
  `P` names the guarded column and holds no null test of its own, so `a IS NULL OR b > 0` is still
  refused: with `a` null it accepts every `b`. `IS DISTINCT FROM <literal>` reduces the same way and
  emits byte for byte what the `<>` it means emits.

  **Arithmetic over two columns stays refused, and now says so.** `x + y < 100` used to report "not a
  single comparison this version understands". It now names the operator, and `drzl doctor` says what
  to do instead. The reason is measured rather than argued: Postgres computes `numeric` exactly and
  JavaScript computes in binary floating point.

  | Column type        | `CHECK (x + y <= 0.3)` with `(0.1, 0.2)` | JavaScript `0.1 + 0.2 <= 0.3` |
  | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
  | `numeric(10,2)`    | accept                                   | false, so it would reject     |
  | `double precision` | reject                                   | false, so it would agree      |

  One expression, two column types, two different correct answers, and the expression does not carry
  the type. A `bigint` pair adds a third, since Postgres raises on overflow where `BigInt` does not.
  Any single reading is wrong for two of the three in the direction that refuses rows the database
  accepts, which is the failure this parser exists to avoid.

  **Ground truth.** 64 probes through a real Postgres (PGlite), one table per constraint so a sibling
  CHECK cannot fail the statement before the value under test is reached, each value put to both the
  database and the emitted insert schema: **0 rows the schema refuses and Postgres accepts**, 58
  agree, 6 wide. Every wide row is a constraint DRZL deliberately enforces nothing for, which is the
  safe direction.

  `IS NULL` on its own is read but enforced nowhere, since narrowing a field to only null would mean
  replacing the column's type rather than wrapping it; `drzl doctor` lists it with that reason.
  `NOT`, `NOT IN` and the boolean `IS TRUE` family remain refused.

- f29bff7: Enforce `CHECK (octet_length(col) <= n)`, which is a byte budget rather than a character count

  `parseCheck` refused `octet_length` outright, on the recorded grounds that a byte count "depends on
  the encoding and cannot be derived from a JavaScript string without choosing one". Both halves of
  that are answerable: the encoding is UTF-8, and a `bytea` column does not arrive as a string at all.
  The constraint is now read and routed into the byte-cap machinery MySQL's TEXT family already used.

  ```ts
  // check('body_bytes', sql`octet_length(${t.body}) <= 5`)      // on a text column
  body: z.string().refine((v) => new TextEncoder().encode(v).length <= 5, {
    message: 'body_bytes: octet_length(body) <= 5',
  }),

  // check('blob_bytes', sql`octet_length(${t.blob}) <= 5`)      // on a bytea column
  blob: z.instanceof(Uint8Array).refine((v) => v.length <= 5, {
    message: 'blob_bytes: octet_length(blob) <= 5',
  }),
  ```

  **Three counts, and no two of them agree.** Measured on PostgreSQL 17.5 through PGlite, on a `text`
  holding three emoji and a `bytea` holding six bytes:

  | expression        | `text` | `bytea`        | JavaScript                                  |
  | ----------------- | ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
  | `octet_length(x)` | 12     | 6              | `new TextEncoder().encode(v).length`        |
  | `length(x)`       | 3      | 6              | `[...v].length`, or `v.length` on the array |
  | `char_length(x)`  | 3      | does not exist | `[...v].length`                             |

  `v.length` on a string is none of them: it counts UTF-16 units, which is 6 for those same three
  emoji. So `length` is a character count on a text column and a byte count on a bytea one, and a
  parser that read `octet_length` as one more spelling of `length` would put a character cap on a byte
  budget. Measured on the real constraint: `CHECK (octet_length(t) <= 5)` accepts `'hello'` and one
  emoji and refuses `'hellos'` and two emoji, and it is the last of those, two characters and eight
  bytes, that a character cap takes and the column does not.

  The parser now carries a `unit` on `LengthCheck`, and `lengthMeasure(column, check)` turns that plus
  the column into one of three JavaScript expressions. It lives in `@drzl/validation-core` so the five
  validation generators, the constraint ledger, `meta` and `drzl doctor` cannot disagree about what is
  enforced.

  **JSON Schema.** No draft has a byte-length keyword, so the same trade the MySQL byte budget already
  made applies: the ceiling becomes `maxLength`, which counts characters and therefore refuses nothing
  the column accepts, and the part it cannot catch is stated in `description`. A `bytea` travels as
  base64, so its cap is the encoded length, `4 * ceil(n / 3)`, which is the padded length of a full
  value and an upper bound on the unpadded one, measured over n = 0 to 20. That also gives a MySQL
  `tinyblob` a bound it never had: 255 bytes is `maxLength: 340`, where the document previously said
  nothing. A byte _floor_ reaches no keyword in either case.

  **What is still refused, and now says so.** A count on a MySQL `binary(n)`/`varbinary(n)` cannot be
  answered: the value arrives as a string from a lossy decode, so neither its characters nor their
  re-encoding is the server's byte count. `drzl doctor` reports that as a new finding kind,
  `check-uncountable`, rather than dropping it silently, and the ledger marks it unenforced with the
  reason. The doctor's note that count clauses were "unreachable from a working schema" was true of
  Postgres and is not true of MySQL, which has `OCTET_LENGTH` and a column whose bytes JavaScript
  cannot see.

### Patch Changes

- 9939e4c: Spell a CHECK's number literals in the column's wire type, so a set on a `bigint({ mode:
'bigint' })` column stops rejecting every row the driver returns

  `CHECK (big IN (1, 2))` on a bigint-mode column emitted `z.union([z.literal(1), z.literal(2)])`,
  and the driver returns `1n` there: strict equality between a bigint and a number is false in
  JavaScript, so the select schema refused every row the database handed back, and the insert schema
  refused every value the driver wants. The OR fold routes `big = 1 OR big = 2` into the same set,
  and the single `big = 1` and `big <> 1` predicates compared with `===`/`!==` had the same wire
  mismatch: the equality never held and the inequality always did, so one rejected everything and
  the other enforced nothing. `bigint({ mode: 'number' })` was always correct, because the driver
  really returns a number there; the fix keys on the analyzer's per-mode `tsType`, which is the
  value's measured wire type, rather than on the SQL type name.

  The spelling per library was measured against the installed versions rather than assumed:

  - **zod, valibot**: `z.literal(1n)` and `v.literal(1n)` accept `1n`, reject `3n` and reject the
    number `1`, so the set stays the same union with the members suffixed. The `=`/`<>` refinements
    compare against `1n`.
  - **ArkType**: the string DSL parses bigint literals. `type('1n | 2n')` enforces the set,
    `type('9223372036854775807n')` holds the 64 bit value exactly, and `type('(1n | 2n)[]')` keeps
    the array wrap. The single equality already went through `atBigintNarrow` and was correct.
  - **TypeBox**: `Type.Literal(1n)` constructs and passes `Value.Check`, and
    `TypeCompiler.Compile` then throws "Preflight validation check failed to guard for the given
    schema", so the literal form would take every compiler-path consumer down. The set and the
    pinned equality go to the registered `DrzlRowCheck` kind intersected with `Type.BigInt()`, the
    same escape hatch the character caps use, which both checkers honour; the static type still
    narrows through `Type.Unsafe<1n | 2n>`, and the document still serialises.
  - **effect**: `Schema.Literal(1n, 2n)` enforces the set; the `<>` filter compares against `1n`.
  - **JSON Schema**: a bigint column is already a digits string in a JSON document, because
    `JSON.stringify` throws on a bigint, so the set becomes `{ enum: ['1', '2'] }` and a pinned
    equality `{ const: '1' }`, in the wire the serialised row can actually hold. This also unrounds
    the 64 bit case: `Number('9223372036854775807')` becomes 9223372036854775808 the moment it is a
    number, and the digit string stays exact.

  A non-integer member has no bigint spelling at all: `1.5n` is a syntax error, and an emitted
  module carrying it would throw at import. Such a member keeps its number spelling, which no stored
  bigint ever equals, exactly as the database says: no bigint column value is 1.5, so `big IN (1.5,
2)` narrows to the 2. The shared decision lives in `wireNumberLiteral` in
  `@drzl/validation-core`, so the six emitters cannot answer it differently.

  The driver-side ground truth is the analyzer's own: `decimal-modes.spec.ts` pins `db.select()`
  returning a real bigint in bigint mode on all three engines, and the `PgBigInt53`/`PgBigInt64`
  arms pin the number mode returning a number, which is why those literals do not change.

- cc26f38: Reconcile a CHECK's literal kind with the column's wire by the database's comparison semantics,
  so a set on a `numeric()` column stops rejecting every row the driver returns

  `CHECK (n IN (1, 2))` on a `numeric()` column (string mode, the default) emitted
  `z.union([z.literal(1), z.literal(2)])`, and the driver returns _decimal text_ there, spelled by
  the declared scale: measured through PGlite on both drizzle majors, a stored 1 comes back `'1'`
  from a bare `numeric`, `'1.00'` from a `numeric(10,2)` and `'1.0000000000'` from a
  `numeric(20,10)`, and mysql2 returns the same shapes for `decimal`. So the select schema refused
  every row the database handed back. Exact string literals are no repair: `'1'` fails against the
  `'1.00'` the scaled column returns, and a bare `numeric` even preserves the insert's own zeros
  (`1.000000` came back `'1.000000'` and `CHECK (n IN (1, 2))` admitted it, because SQL numeric
  equality is scale insensitive: `1 = 1.00` is true, measured on PostgreSQL 17.5 and MySQL 8.4.11).

  The same rule gap ran the other way. The database coerces a quoted literal to the column's type
  before comparing (`bigint CHECK (big IN ('1','2'))` admitted 1 and refused 3;
  `integer CHECK (age IN ('18'))` admitted 18), while the emitted schemas compared the raw text:
  `z.enum(["1","2"])` refused every `1n` a bigint-mode column returns, `big = '1'` compared
  `v === "1"` which no bigint ever satisfies, and `age IN ('18')` refused the number 18.

  The repair is one shared policy in `@drzl/validation-core`, extending `wireNumberLiteral`'s rule
  to the whole comparison: the literal's kind and the column's wire are reconciled by what the
  database does, never by the source spelling.

  - **Numeric string wires** (`numeric`/`decimal` string modes, v1 `bigint({ mode: 'string' })`):
    equality, inequality and sets compare _canonical decimal spellings_ through a `DrzlNumericCanon`
    helper emitted once per file, dependency free: sign normalised, leading integer zeros and
    trailing fraction zeros stripped, a bare trailing dot dropped, then compared as strings. Exact
    at any precision on purpose: `Number()` is not usable here, because a numeric column carries
    more digits than a double holds and `Number('99999999999999999999')` equals
    `Number('99999999999999999998')`. zod and valibot refine, ArkType narrows, TypeBox rides the
    registered `DrzlRowCheck` kind under both checkers, effect filters. JSON Schema cannot run a
    function, so the set becomes a `pattern`: one alternation branch per member, accepting exactly
    the spellings that canonicalise to it, ajv strict valid on every target; the cost is the
    regex's readability, not admitted rows. Ranges there keep their coerced numeric compare,
    now spelled `Number(v) >= 1` so the comparison is visible and the module typechecks.
  - **Number and bigint wires**: quoted plain-decimal literals are respelled to their number-kind
    selves (canonicalised first: `018` and `018n` are syntax errors in an emitted module) and every
    existing arm applies, `wireNumberLiteral`'s bigint suffix included. `big IN ('1','2')` now
    emits byte for byte what `big IN (1, 2)` emits.
  - **What no exact compare can state is left unenforced and reported, never guessed.** Three
    measured shapes: a number literal against a text column (Postgres refuses the DDL outright;
    MySQL creates it and admits `'1.00'`, `'1'` and `'2.0'` through double coercion), quoted text
    that is not plain decimal on a number or bigint wire, and a member outside the canonical domain
    on a numeric wire (`CHECK (n IN ('1e3', '2'))` is valid DDL whose rows come back `'1000'`).
    Each falls back to the base schema, which accepts every value the driver returns for admitted
    rows, and the constraint ledger carries the reason: enforcing a guess would reject rows the
    database admits, which is the defect class this fixes.

  The ledger and `meta` apply the same policy through `classifyTableChecks`, so a respelled
  constraint renders the message the emitted module writes and an unenforced clause says why
  instead of being claimed. TypeBox also stops planting a dead `minimum` keyword on
  `Type.String()`, which validated nothing and serialised as if enforced.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4efd19b: Emitted validators can now give every key a nominal type, so a `users.id` cannot be passed where a
  `posts.id` is wanted.

  `{ kind: 'zod', path: 'src/validators/zod', branded: true }`, on all five validation generators.

  ```ts
  export const SelectpostsSchema = z.object({
    id: z.number().int().brand<'posts.id'>(),
    authorId: z.number().int().brand<'users.id'>(),
  });

  export type PostsId = z.output<typeof SelectpostsSchema>['id'];
  ```

  ```ts
  loadUser(post.authorId); // fine
  loadUser(post.id); // Type 'number & $brand<"posts.id">' is not assignable to
  //                    parameter of type 'number & $brand<"users.id">'
  ```

  **Nothing happens at runtime.** Measured on zod 4.4.3, `.brand()` returns the same schema object it
  was called on, by identity, and `parse(1)` is `1`; valibot 1.4.2, arktype 2.2.3 and effect 3.x all
  hand the value back unchanged, and TypeBox's marker is a cast that leaves the schema object
  byte-identical. So this cannot change what a schema accepts, and the whole feature is what `tsc`
  prints. It is proved that way: the test suite compiles generated modules and asserts that
  `@ts-expect-error` on each rejection is used, that the same file without the directives produces
  exactly those errors, and that the identical calls against unbranded output produce none.

  **Foreign keys carry the brand of the column they reference**, resolved transitively, and that beats
  the column being part of its own table's key. `posts.authorId` is a `users.id`; a join table keyed
  on `(orgId, userId)` is `orgs.id` and `users.id`, not two brands nothing else produces. Without this
  the feature would only stop you swapping two tables' own ids, while every id actually flowing
  between your tables stayed a plain number.

  **The brand token is `<export name>.<column>`, verbatim.** Nothing is transformed, so the token is
  unique by construction and two tables cannot collide after a transformation. The exported alias has
  to be an identifier and is `PascalCase(table) + PascalCase(column)`; `user_accounts` and
  `userAccounts` do collide there, and when they do neither alias is emitted and the run says so. The
  schemas are unaffected, because they carry the token and never the alias.

  **The brand goes inside the `nullable` and `optional` wrappers**, and that is the one decision that
  could be wrong while still compiling. A brand is an intersection and `null & { ... }` is `never`, so
  `z.number().nullable().brand<'users.id'>()` infers `number & $brand<"users.id">` with the null arm
  silently gone while `.parse(null)` still returns null. The same trap is in valibot, effect and
  TypeBox. All five emit `(number & brand) | null`.

  **`typedColumns` is not emitted for a branded column.** Both narrow the same column's static type and
  whichever runs second wins, and applying the brand to the reference hits the null problem above. The
  brand wins outright rather than the two being emitted to fight; nothing is lost for an ordinary key,
  whose branded type is Drizzle's inferred type plus a marker. A key declared with `.$type<T>()` is the
  one case that costs something, and it is documented.

  **TypeBox has no brand at all** and still expresses one. There is no `Type.Brand` and nothing
  brand-shaped on `Type`, measured on 0.34.52 by enumerating its keys. What it has is `TUnsafe<T>`, its
  own primitive for "this schema, that static type", which the generator already uses for
  `typedColumns`. A branded file declares one helper whose value is the schema itself, so `Value.Check`,
  `TypeCompiler` and the JSON Schema `JSON.stringify` produces are all unchanged. The marker is a
  string-keyed property rather than a `unique symbol` on purpose: a `unique symbol` is unique per
  declaration, so two generated files would produce two unrelated brands and a foreign key would not be
  assignable to the key it points at.

  **Which types change differs by library, and branding only makes it visible.** zod, valibot and effect
  name their insert type from the schema's _input_ type, which a brand does not touch, so writes stay
  plain and only rows read back carry brands. ArkType and TypeBox name theirs from the output type, so
  an insert payload there wants a branded id.

  Off by default: it changes the inferred type of every consumer of the select schemas, which is the
  point, but it is a change to existing call sites rather than an addition. A full generated project,
  validators for all five libraries plus a service and both routers, typechecks with it on under
  `nodenext` with `noUnusedLocals`: the generated service types its key as `id: number` from Drizzle,
  and a branded id is still a number, so every call into it still compiles. Emitted source grows about
  10%, all of it text, none of it reaching runtime.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3b53229: Add `@drzl/generator-effect`: Effect Schema validators from a Drizzle schema.

  `{ kind: 'effect', path: 'src/validators/effect' }` emits an insert, update and select schema per
  table, built on `effect/Schema` from `effect` core 3.x. Everything the other validation generators
  handle is handled here: every column type the analyzer produces, nullable against optional, CHECK
  constraints through `parseCheck` including the array and JSON guards, declared numeric precision
  and bounds, `maxLength`/`maxBytes`, `applyDefaults`, `typedJson`, `typedColumns`, `duplicateFinder`,
  `coerceDates`, affixes and nested relation schemas.

  Three things differ from the existing four, each measured rather than assumed:

  - **Both a bare and a Standard Schema form are emitted.** A bare `Schema.Struct` carries no
    `~standard` key, so `Standard<Name>` is exported beside every schema as
    `Schema.standardSchemaV1(<Name>)`. The bare form is the one that composes, since the wrapper drops
    `.fields`. This is the difference from TypeBox, which has no route to Standard Schema at all.
  - **`Schema.Number` accepts `NaN` and both infinities**, which is the opposite of `z.number()` and
    `Type.Number()`. Numeric columns therefore build on `Schema.Finite`, unconditionally rather than
    relying on the range, since `Infinity >= 0` is true.
  - **`effect` is an optional peer**, unlike the required validator peers of the other four.
    `drizzle-orm@1.0.0-rc.4` declares its own optional peer on `effect` as
    `>=4.0.0-beta.83 || >=4.0.0`, and npm auto-installs a required peer, so declaring one made
    `npm install @drzl/cli drizzle-orm@1.0.0-rc.4` fail with `ERESOLVE` for every consumer. Install
    `effect` yourself; the floor is 3.13.0, where `Schema.standardSchemaV1` first appears.

  Character limits are counted in code points rather than UTF-16 units, so a `varchar(10)` accepts ten
  astral-plane characters exactly as the database does.

  `ValidationLibrary` in `@drzl/validation-core` gains `'effect'`, and the CLI wires the new kind into
  both the `generate` and `watch` dispatch loops and into `computeGeneratorOutputDirs`.
