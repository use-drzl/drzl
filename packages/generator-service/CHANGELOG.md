- 44b34b2: Stop shipping prettier inside three packages, and make the CommonJS build format at all

  `@drzl/validation-core`, `@drzl/generator-orpc` and `@drzl/generator-service` each published at
  about 2.8 MB packed and 11 MB unpacked. All three carried a copy of `formatCode` built on
  `await import('prettier')`, which is a specifier tsup resolves statically, so esbuild inlined the
  whole formatter behind it: prettier's Flow parser, its TypeScript parser, babel, postcss, yaml and
  the rest. Installing `@drzl/cli` pulled in roughly 32 MB of duplicated parsers.

  Prettier is now an optional peer dependency, marked external in every build that can reach it.
  The two private copies of `formatCode` are gone; both packages use the one exported by
  `@drzl/validation-core`, which they already depended on. The three packages now publish at 34 KB,
  15 KB and 8 KB packed, and 88 KB, 59 KB and 18 KB unpacked.

  **What changes for you.** DRZL formats with the prettier already in your project, using your
  config, exactly as before. If your project has no prettier and no biome, generated files are
  written as rendered: the same valid TypeScript with worse whitespace, rather than nothing at all.
  Add `prettier` as a dev dependency if you want it formatted.

  Along the way this fixes formatting for CommonJS consumers, where it never worked. The bundled
  prettier in `dist/index.cjs` called `createRequire(import.meta.url)`, and `import.meta.url` is
  undefined in a CJS bundle, so the first call threw, the `catch` swallowed it and the code came
  back unformatted. Every `require('@drzl/validation-core')` consumer carried 5.5 MB of formatter
  that could not run. Resolving the real prettier fixes it.

### Patch Changes

- 9e86204: `validation.importPath`, `dbImportPath` and `schemaImportPath` now produce imports that resolve.
  They were emitted verbatim, so the config in the getting-started guide generated three imports
  that resolved to nothing, under every module resolution.

  These options get written as project-relative paths, `src/validators/zod`, because that is how
  the rest of the config names directories. Emitted verbatim that is a _bare_ specifier: Node and
  tsc look for a package of that name in node_modules and never consider the local file.

      from "src/validators/zod"          before
      from "../validators/zod/index.js"  after

  Each configured path is now classified before use. A package name (`zod`, `@acme/schemas`) is
  left exactly as written. A path already relative keeps its own spelling and only has its
  extension corrected, so anyone who followed the older guidance and wrote
  `../validators/zod/index.js` is unaffected. Anything else is treated as project-relative and
  rewritten against the directory of the file doing the importing.

  Whether a path names a file or a directory is asked of the filesystem, because
  `src/db/connection` and `src/validators/zod` are indistinguishable as strings and are usually a
  file and a directory holding a barrel. A directory gains `/index`. Where nothing exists yet,
  which happens when one generator runs before the one that writes its target, an extensionless
  path is taken to be a directory, since these options name directories by convention and the only
  path that can legitimately be missing is a generated barrel.

  Since a non-relative value could only ever have produced an import that resolved to nothing,
  rewriting it cannot break a setup that worked.

  Exposed by `resolveConfiguredImport` in `@drzl/validation-core`, so all three call sites share
  one rule.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b8b44ec: Two defects in generated output that stopped it resolving or typechecking, both found by running
  the published packages rather than the workspace.

  **The service import was not a usable specifier.** `@drzl/template-orpc-service` built it by
  hand and got two things wrong at once:

      import { PostService } from "services/postService";       // before
      import { PostService } from "./services/postService.js";  // after

  `path.relative` returns a bare `services` whenever the services directory sits inside the
  router's output directory, and a specifier without a leading `./` is a _bare_ specifier: Node
  looks for a package of that name in node_modules and never considers the file next door. It also
  carried no extension, making it the one relative import DRZL emitted that failed under
  `moduleResolution: node16` and `nodenext`, despite 2.0.0 stating that every relative specifier
  now ends in `.js`. It goes through `importSpecifier` now, the same helper the router barrel uses,
  so it honours `importExtension` like everything else. `@drzl/generator-orpc` also now passes
  `importExtension` into the template context, which it previously had no way to see.

  **Service types rejected `null` for nullable columns.** A nullable column was emitted as
  optional, which admits `undefined` and not `null`:

      balance?: number          // before
      balance: number | null    // after, in Select
      balance?: number | null   // after, in Insert and Update

  Optional and nullable are different: `foo?: T` means the key may be absent, `foo: T | null` means
  it is present and may be null. So a row read back with a real `null` did not match `Select`, and
  passing `null` to update was a type error, while the validation generators emitted
  `z.number().nullable()` for the same column. Both halves of one generated project disagreed about
  the same database. `Select` no longer marks anything optional either: a row read back carries
  every column, whatever its default.

  Both were invisible because `scripts/verify-packed.sh` ran the oRPC generator with the default
  template, which imports nothing DRZL generated and never touches the service types. It now uses
  `@drzl/template-orpc-service`, so every generated module is imported and typechecked by another.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 9e87f39: `includeRelations` now generates endpoints. It was accepted and then ignored: nothing in the
  package ever read `analysis.relations` or `Table.foreignKeys`, so setting it changed no byte of
  output while docs/examples/relations.md promised endpoints like `listByParentId`.

  Each single-column foreign key now produces a lookup on its own table's router, named after the
  column that holds it. A `posts` table with `authorId` gains `listByAuthorId`, taking
  `{ authorId }` and returning an array of that table's select schema, in whichever validation
  library is configured.

  Naming follows the column rather than the referenced table, because two keys frequently point at
  the same table: `authorId` and `editorId` both referencing `users` yield `listByAuthorId` and
  `listByEditorId`, where naming by table would emit one procedure twice under the same key.

  Composite foreign keys are skipped, having no single scalar to accept. The inverse direction is
  not generated, since it would return another table's rows and require an import the file cannot
  resolve. Many-to-many links are reported by the analyzer but not yet traversed by the generator.

  Procedures are synthesised by the generator rather than by a template, so the flag works with
  every template including custom ones. They are strictly additive: the CRUD surface is identical
  whether or not the flag is set, and a template declaring a procedure of the same name keeps its
  own.

  Also removes `src/analyzer-types.d.ts` from this package and from `@drzl/generator-service`. Each
  was a `declare module '@drzl/analyzer'` block that shadowed the real types of a package both
  already depend on, with a hand-maintained subset that had drifted: no `primaryKey`, `unique`,
  `indexes`, `checks` or `foreignKeys`, and `relations` typed as `any[]`. Both packages compile
  against the genuine types now, so the analyzer's shape cannot silently disagree with what its
  consumers believe it to be.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6903012: **Breaking:** every relative specifier DRZL generates now ends in `.js`, so the generated
  tree compiles under `moduleResolution: node16` and `nodenext`.

  ### What you will see

  Regenerate and the specifiers gain an extension. Nothing else about the output changes, and
  no file is renamed:

  ```diff
    // src/validators/zod/index.ts
  - export * from './users.zod';
  + export * from './users.zod.js';

    // src/api/index.ts
  - import { users } from './users';
  + import { users } from './users.js';

    // src/services/userService.ts
  - import type { Insertusers, Updateusers, Selectusers } from './types/users';
  + import type { Insertusers, Updateusers, Selectusers } from './types/users.js';
  ```

  If your build already worked, it still works: `./users.zod.js` resolves to `users.zod.ts`
  under `bundler` and `node10` exactly as the extensionless form did, and it is what Vite,
  esbuild, Rollup, Bun, Vitest and Next.js expect. It will show up in your next diff, and it
  is a good idea to regenerate in one commit of its own.

  ### Why

  Generated files land in your own source tree, so your `tsconfig.json` decides which
  specifiers resolve. Measured against tsc 5.9.2 and 7.0.2, for a specifier naming a sibling
  `.ts` file:

  | specifier        | `bundler` | `node10` | `node16`/`nodenext`, CommonJS | `node16`/`nodenext`, ESM |
  | ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
  | `./users.zod.js` | resolves  | resolves | resolves                      | resolves                 |
  | `./users.zod`    | resolves  | resolves | resolves                      | **does not resolve**     |

  The extensionless form DRZL emitted before this release cannot be imported from an ES module
  under `node16` or `nodenext`. `tsc` reports `TS2307: Cannot find module './users.zod'` on the
  barrel and the build stops, and that was true of the default `fileSuffix`, not only of custom
  ones. That combination is now the common one: `tsc --init` has emitted `"module": "nodenext"`
  since TypeScript 5.9, every `@tsconfig/node*` base sets `"moduleResolution": "node16"`, and
  TypeScript 7 removed `node10` altogether, leaving `bundler`, `node16` and `nodenext` as the
  only three settings that exist.

  ### If `.js` is wrong for you

  Set `importExtension`, at the top level for every generator or on a single generator to
  override it:

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    schema: 'src/db/schema.ts',
    importExtension: 'none', // 'js' (default) | 'none' | 'ts'
    generators: [{ kind: 'zod', path: 'src/validators/zod' }],
  });
  ```

  - `'none'` restores the pre-2.0 output byte for byte. Use it if your pipeline cannot map
    `.js` back to `.ts`: webpack without `resolve.extensionAlias`, or Jest with `ts-jest` and
    no `moduleNameMapper`.
  - `'ts'` emits `./users.zod.ts`, which needs `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true`. It is the
    only form Node's own type stripping accepts, so it suits running the generated `.ts`
    unbuilt.

  `importExtension` only touches specifiers DRZL invents. Paths you write yourself are still
  emitted verbatim, so on `node16`/`nodenext` in an ES module an `orpc` generator's
  `validation.importPath` has to name the barrel file rather than its directory
  (`'../validators/zod/index.js'`, not `'../validators/zod'`), and the `service` generator's
  `dbImportPath` and `schemaImportPath` need their own `.js`.

  `@drzl/validation-core` exports `ImportExtension`, `DEFAULT_IMPORT_EXTENSION`,
  `IMPORT_EXTENSIONS` and `importSpecifier`, and `moduleSpecifier` takes the extension as a
  third argument, so the five generators cannot disagree about how a module is spelled.
  `@drzl/generator-service` gains a dependency on `@drzl/validation-core` for that reason.

### Minor Changes

- 549ee51: Type `numeric` and `decimal` columns as strings, matching what Drizzle returns.

  Generated validators previously typed them as numbers, so a select schema
  rejected every row the database returned ("expected number, received string"),
  and an insert schema rejected the string the driver wants while accepting a
  number it does not.

  `bigint({ mode: 'number' })` is now read as a number rather than a bigint, and
  `real`/`doublePrecision` are separated from `numeric` since those really are
  JS numbers.

  If you were working around the old behaviour by coercing numeric values, that
  workaround should be removed.
