# @drzl/validation-core

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e86204: `validation.importPath`, `dbImportPath` and `schemaImportPath` now produce imports that resolve.
  They were emitted verbatim, so the config in the getting-started guide generated three imports
  that resolved to nothing, under every module resolution.

  These options get written as project-relative paths, `src/validators/zod`, because that is how
  the rest of the config names directories. Emitted verbatim that is a _bare_ specifier: Node and
  tsc look for a package of that name in node_modules and never consider the local file.

      from "src/validators/zod"          before
      from "../validators/zod/index.js"  after

  Each configured path is now classified before use. A package name (`zod`, `@acme/schemas`) is
  left exactly as written. A path already relative keeps its own spelling and only has its
  extension corrected, so anyone who followed the older guidance and wrote
  `../validators/zod/index.js` is unaffected. Anything else is treated as project-relative and
  rewritten against the directory of the file doing the importing.

  Whether a path names a file or a directory is asked of the filesystem, because
  `src/db/connection` and `src/validators/zod` are indistinguishable as strings and are usually a
  file and a directory holding a barrel. A directory gains `/index`. Where nothing exists yet,
  which happens when one generator runs before the one that writes its target, an extensionless
  path is taken to be a directory, since these options name directories by convention and the only
  path that can legitimately be missing is a generated barrel.

  Since a non-relative value could only ever have produced an import that resolved to nothing,
  rewriting it cannot break a setup that worked.

  Exposed by `resolveConfiguredImport` in `@drzl/validation-core`, so all three call sites share
  one rule.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6903012: **Breaking:** every relative specifier DRZL generates now ends in `.js`, so the generated
  tree compiles under `moduleResolution: node16` and `nodenext`.

  ### What you will see

  Regenerate and the specifiers gain an extension. Nothing else about the output changes, and
  no file is renamed:

  ```diff
    // src/validators/zod/index.ts
  - export * from './users.zod';
  + export * from './users.zod.js';

    // src/api/index.ts
  - import { users } from './users';
  + import { users } from './users.js';

    // src/services/userService.ts
  - import type { Insertusers, Updateusers, Selectusers } from './types/users';
  + import type { Insertusers, Updateusers, Selectusers } from './types/users.js';
  ```

  If your build already worked, it still works: `./users.zod.js` resolves to `users.zod.ts`
  under `bundler` and `node10` exactly as the extensionless form did, and it is what Vite,
  esbuild, Rollup, Bun, Vitest and Next.js expect. It will show up in your next diff, and it
  is a good idea to regenerate in one commit of its own.

  ### Why

  Generated files land in your own source tree, so your `tsconfig.json` decides which
  specifiers resolve. Measured against tsc 5.9.2 and 7.0.2, for a specifier naming a sibling
  `.ts` file:

  | specifier        | `bundler` | `node10` | `node16`/`nodenext`, CommonJS | `node16`/`nodenext`, ESM |
  | ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
  | `./users.zod.js` | resolves  | resolves | resolves                      | resolves                 |
  | `./users.zod`    | resolves  | resolves | resolves                      | **does not resolve**     |

  The extensionless form DRZL emitted before this release cannot be imported from an ES module
  under `node16` or `nodenext`. `tsc` reports `TS2307: Cannot find module './users.zod'` on the
  barrel and the build stops, and that was true of the default `fileSuffix`, not only of custom
  ones. That combination is now the common one: `tsc --init` has emitted `"module": "nodenext"`
  since TypeScript 5.9, every `@tsconfig/node*` base sets `"moduleResolution": "node16"`, and
  TypeScript 7 removed `node10` altogether, leaving `bundler`, `node16` and `nodenext` as the
  only three settings that exist.

  ### If `.js` is wrong for you

  Set `importExtension`, at the top level for every generator or on a single generator to
  override it:

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    schema: 'src/db/schema.ts',
    importExtension: 'none', // 'js' (default) | 'none' | 'ts'
    generators: [{ kind: 'zod', path: 'src/validators/zod' }],
  });
  ```

  - `'none'` restores the pre-2.0 output byte for byte. Use it if your pipeline cannot map
    `.js` back to `.ts`: webpack without `resolve.extensionAlias`, or Jest with `ts-jest` and
    no `moduleNameMapper`.
  - `'ts'` emits `./users.zod.ts`, which needs `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true`. It is the
    only form Node's own type stripping accepts, so it suits running the generated `.ts`
    unbuilt.

  `importExtension` only touches specifiers DRZL invents. Paths you write yourself are still
  emitted verbatim, so on `node16`/`nodenext` in an ES module an `orpc` generator's
  `validation.importPath` has to name the barrel file rather than its directory
  (`'../validators/zod/index.js'`, not `'../validators/zod'`), and the `service` generator's
  `dbImportPath` and `schemaImportPath` need their own `.js`.

  `@drzl/validation-core` exports `ImportExtension`, `DEFAULT_IMPORT_EXTENSION`,
  `IMPORT_EXTENSIONS` and `importSpecifier`, and `moduleSpecifier` takes the extension as a
  third argument, so the five generators cannot disagree about how a module is spelled.
  `@drzl/generator-service` gains a dependency on `@drzl/validation-core` for that reason.

### Minor Changes

- 2f9214e: Add `affix`, so generated identifiers are not stuck on `Insert<Table>Schema`.

  Resolves #16. Set `affix` on a `zod`, `valibot` or `arktype` generator to choose
  the prefix and suffix of the exported schema constants and of the type aliases,
  separately, and either as one string for all three modes or per mode:

  ```ts
  {
    kind: 'zod',
    path: 'src/validators/zod',
    affix: {
      tableCase: 'pascal',
      schema: { suffix: 'Schema' },
      type: {
        prefix: { insert: 'Create', update: 'Edit', select: '' },
        suffix: { insert: 'Input', update: 'Input', select: '' },
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  which emits `InsertUsersSchema`, `CreateUsersInput`, `EditUsersInput` and a bare
  `Users` instead of `InsertusersSchema` and `SelectusersOutput`.

  `tableCase` addresses the second half of that issue. Generated identifiers
  interpolate the Drizzle export name exactly as written, so a table exported as
  `users` produces `Insertusers`. `tableCase: 'pascal'` upper-camels it first,
  splitting on `_`, `-` and camel boundaries, so `user_profiles` and `userProfiles`
  both give `InsertUserProfilesSchema`. The default is `preserve`, which keeps the
  existing behaviour; changing the default is a major-version decision.

  Naming now comes from one resolver in `@drzl/validation-core`
  (`resolveAffix`, `schemaName`, `typeName`, `validateAffix`, `pascalCase`) instead of
  template literals repeated in four packages, which is what lets both sides of an
  import agree. When an `orpc` generator uses `validation.useShared` and exactly one
  sibling generator produces that library, the sibling's `affix` is copied onto it,
  so the router imports the names the validation generator actually exported.
  A `validation.affix` that is set explicitly and disagrees with that sibling now
  fails the run, listing both sets of names, rather than writing a router that does
  not compile.

  Configs are checked before anything is written: an affix that could not appear in
  a TypeScript identifier, or that would put two same-named exports in one file, is
  rejected with the path to the offending option.

  Nothing changes for existing configs. Omitting `affix` reproduces the previous
  output byte for byte, `schemaSuffix` still works and is the default for
  `affix.schema.suffix`, and affixes rename identifiers only, never files or module
  specifiers.

- 6034a24: Make the generated barrel follow `fileSuffix` instead of the default suffix.

  The zod, valibot and arktype generators named each emitted file from `fileSuffix` but wrote
  the barrel with the default suffix hardcoded, so any custom value produced an `index.ts`
  full of imports that pointed at nothing:

  ```ts
  // drzl.config.ts
  { kind: 'zod', path: 'src/validators/zod', fileSuffix: '.schema.ts' }
  ```

  ```ts
  // src/validators/zod/index.ts, next to users.schema.ts and posts.schema.ts
  export * from './users.zod'; // TS2307: Cannot find module './users.zod'
  export * from './posts.zod';
  ```

  The consumer's build failed on the unresolved imports, and so did anything importing the
  barrel, including an `orpc` generator pointed at it through `validation.importPath`. The
  only `fileSuffix` that worked was the default one. Both halves now come from the same
  value, so the barrel renames along with the files.

  Suffixes that are not simply `.<name>.ts` are handled too. A suffix with no leading dot
  runs straight onto the table name (`Schema.ts` gives `usersSchema.ts` and
  `./usersSchema.js`), a suffix that is only an extension leaves the bare table name (`.ts`
  gives `users.ts` and `./users.js`), and `.mts` and `.cts` are written as `.mjs` and `.cjs`,
  which is the only form TypeScript resolves for them.

  Leaving `fileSuffix` unset no longer reproduces the pre-2.0 barrel byte for byte, but that
  is down to the separate `importExtension` change in this same release, which puts a `.js` on
  every specifier DRZL generates. Set `importExtension: 'none'` and the default output is what
  it always was.

  `@drzl/validation-core` exports the two helpers the generators share, `moduleFileName` and
  `moduleSpecifier`, so the file name and the import specifier cannot drift apart again.
