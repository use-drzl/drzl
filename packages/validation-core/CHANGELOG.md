# @drzl/validation-core

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5a99384: New generator: `@drzl/generator-typebox`.

  ```ts
  { kind: 'typebox', path: 'src/validators/typebox' }
  ```

  TypeBox is the second most used validator in the Drizzle ecosystem: `drizzle-typebox` at 41,537
  weekly downloads beats `drizzle-valibot` (17,216) and `drizzle-arktype` (6,761) _combined_ by
  1.73x. DRZL shipped both of the smaller ones and not this one.

  It has everything the other three generators have: column constraints, CHECK constraint
  enforcement, `typedJson`, affixes, file suffixes and import extensions. Because TypeBox is JSON
  Schema, constraints are keywords rather than chained calls, which makes the output the most
  directly readable of the four and usable by anything that speaks JSON Schema:

  ```ts
  export const SelectpeopleSchema = Type.Object({
    age: Type.Integer({ minimum: 18, maximum: 2147483647 }), // CHECK (age >= 18)
    score: Type.Union([Type.Integer({ minimum: 0, maximum: 100 }), Type.Null()]),
    tier: Type.Literal('gold'), // CHECK (tier = 'gold')
  });
  ```

  ### Two places TypeBox fails silently, both handled

  TypeBox accepts an option it does not understand for a given type and then ignores it, so a
  schema can look right, compile, and validate nothing. Both of these were found by running the
  emitted schemas rather than reading them:

  - **`format` needs registration.** `Type.String({ format: 'uuid' })` returns `false` for a
    perfectly valid uuid in any project that has not populated `FormatRegistry`. A uuid column is
    emitted as a `pattern` instead, which needs no setup.
  - **`const` is ignored on `String` and `Integer`.** `Type.String({ const: 'gold' })` validates
    `'silver'`, and `Type.Integer({ const: 5 })` validates `6`. An equality check is emitted as
    `Type.Literal` instead, which is the only form that enforces.

  The test suite writes the emitted module to disk, imports it, and runs `Value.Check` against it,
  because asserting on generated source text cannot tell the difference between a schema that
  validates and one that merely parses.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d2ac66d: Two things no runtime-derived validator can do.

  ### `typedJson`: json columns typed from your schema

  `.$type<T>()` is a compile-time cast. Drizzle implements it as `$type() { return this }`, so
  nothing about the declared type survives to runtime and every runtime-derived validator is blind
  to it. `drizzle-orm/zod` types a json column as its generic `Json` whatever you wrote, and that
  is the highest-reaction open issue on the repository.

  A generator does not have to resolve the type itself, because Drizzle already did:

  ```ts
  prefs: z.custom<(typeof settings.$inferSelect)["prefs"]>(),
  ```

  `typeof settings.$inferSelect['prefs']` _is_ the declared type, resolved by TypeScript at the
  point of use. So generics, unions and imported interfaces all work, which are exactly the cases
  that defeat approaches that parse the source and rebuild the type. Insert and select reference
  their own inference, since a defaulted json column is optional on insert and its type differs.

  Enable per generator:

  ```ts
  { kind: 'zod', path: 'src/validators/zod', typedJson: true }
  ```

  Off by default: it adds an `import type` of your schema module to the generated file. That import
  is erased at build time, so it adds no runtime dependency and cannot create a runtime cycle, but
  the coupling should still be a choice.

  Verified by compiling the result: `z.infer<typeof SelectsettingsSchema>['prefs']` is the declared
  type, a wrong shape is a type error, and it is assignable back to the original interface.

  ### `drzl generate --check`: drift detection for CI

  ```bash
  drzl generate --check
  ```

  Regenerates and fails if the result differs from what is committed, naming every file:

  ```
  Generated output is out of date (2 file(s)):
    ~ changed  src/validators/zod/people.zod.ts
    + added    src/validators/zod/extra.zod.ts
  ```

  Exits 1 on drift and 0 when current. It catches the two things that actually happen, someone
  editing generated files by hand and someone changing the schema without regenerating, and it
  catches them in CI rather than in review.

  This is only available to a code generator. Runtime modules derive their schemas in memory at
  import time, so there is nothing on disk to have drifted and nothing to compare.

  **It never modifies your working tree.** Redirecting output to a temporary directory would not
  work, since generated files contain paths computed relative to their own location and every file
  would report as drifted. So the real directories are snapshotted, regeneration is allowed to
  overwrite them, and the snapshot is restored either way, including deleting anything the run
  created.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c90fd42: **Generated Zod schemas now enforce CHECK constraints. No official Drizzle validator does.**

  Verified against `drizzle-orm/zod` at 1.0.0-rc.4: a table declaring
  `check('age_adult', sql`${t.age} >= 18`)` produces an insert schema that accepts `{ age: 5 }`.
  The constraint is right there in the schema, the database will reject the row, and the validator
  says nothing. Same for valibot, arktype and typebox.

  DRZL emits:

  ```ts
  age: z.number().int().gte(-2147483648).lte(2147483647)
    .refine((v) => v >= 18, { message: "age_adult: age >= 18" }),
  ```

  `BETWEEN 0 AND 100` becomes two refinements. The constraint name is in the message, so a failure
  points at the thing in the schema that caused it.

  ### It refuses more than it accepts, on purpose

  Only a comparison naming one column against one literal is translated. A schema that quietly
  enforces a _guess_ at your constraint is worse than one enforcing nothing, because it rejects
  rows the database would have accepted. Skipped, not guessed: comparisons between two columns
  (`start_date < end_date`, a statement about the row rather than a field), compound predicates,
  function calls, and regex matches, whose `~` in Postgres is POSIX ERE and not JavaScript's
  dialect.

  ### Two pieces of SQL semantics that a naive version gets wrong

  **A CHECK passes on TRUE or NULL.** So `CHECK (score >= 0)` on a nullable column accepts NULL.
  The refinement is applied to the inner type and `.nullable()` wraps it, which reproduces that
  exactly rather than being stricter than the database.

  **The bound has to survive.** `sql`${t.age} >= ${MIN}`` used to render as `age >= ?`, because
  `renderSql` mapped an interpolated value to `?`. Drizzle puts a primitive into the chunk list as
  itself rather than wrapping it, so the value was there all along and was being discarded. Any
  refinement built from that expression would have been built from a hole. Fixed in the analyzer,
  which also makes `Table.checks[].expression` correct for anything else reading it.

  Valibot and ArkType keep their current output; the parser lives in `@drzl/validation-core` as
  `parseCheck`, so they can adopt it without reimplementing it.

- Updated dependencies [6d6857f]
  - @drzl/analyzer@1.6.0

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- b0543a4: **Breaking:** insert schemas now contain the primary key when the database does not supply one.
  They omitted it unconditionally, so for a natural or non-generated key the schema could not
  express a valid insert: the required column was simply absent, with no way to provide it.

  `isGeneratedColumn` answered `c.isGenerated || primaryKeyColumns.includes(c.name)`, dropping
  every primary key whether or not the database generated it. Being a key says nothing about who
  supplies the value. The question is whether the database provides one, which `isGenerated`
  answers for columns that cannot be written and `hasDefault` for columns that need not be.

  ### What changes

  | column                                                       | before  | after                 |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | --------------------- |
  | `serial('id').primaryKey()`, pg                              | omitted | present, **optional** |
  | `integer('id').primaryKey().generatedAlwaysAsIdentity()`, pg | omitted | present, **optional** |
  | `integer('id').primaryKey()`, pg                             | omitted | present, **required** |
  | `text('slug').primaryKey()`                                  | omitted | present, **required** |
  | `integer('id').primaryKey()`, sqlite                         | omitted | present, **optional** |
  | `int('id').primaryKey().autoincrement()`, mysql              | omitted | omitted               |

  An auto-generated key stays absent, since it cannot be written. A defaulted key is present and
  optional, so it may be supplied or left out; previously neither was possible. A key the caller
  has to supply is present and required, which is what makes the insert expressible at all.

  This can fail a build that regenerates, and that is the point: those call sites were building
  inserts with no primary key, which the database would have rejected at runtime. Postgres does
  not generate `integer('id').primaryKey()`; only `serial` and identity columns are generated.

  ### The analyzer half

  `hasDefault` was computed from `col.default` and `col.config.default`, neither of which Drizzle
  populates. It now reads `col.hasDefault`, which Drizzle does set, plus `defaultFn` for runtime
  defaults. Without this the two halves of the table above are indistinguishable: every Postgres
  `serial`, every identity column and every SQLite rowid alias reported `hasDefault: false`,
  exactly like a plain `integer('id').primaryKey()`.

  That fix also reaches ordinary columns: any column whose default came from `.default()` or
  `.$defaultFn()` was previously reported as having none, so it was emitted as required in insert
  schemas rather than optional.

  `@drzl/generator-orpc` already filtered on `isGenerated` alone for its inline schemas, so its
  output was correct and is unchanged apart from the improved `hasDefault` signal. The standalone
  validation generators and the shared schemas disagreed with it until now.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [b0543a4]
  - @drzl/analyzer@1.5.0

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e86204: `validation.importPath`, `dbImportPath` and `schemaImportPath` now produce imports that resolve.
  They were emitted verbatim, so the config in the getting-started guide generated three imports
  that resolved to nothing, under every module resolution.

  These options get written as project-relative paths, `src/validators/zod`, because that is how
  the rest of the config names directories. Emitted verbatim that is a _bare_ specifier: Node and
  tsc look for a package of that name in node_modules and never consider the local file.

      from "src/validators/zod"          before
      from "../validators/zod/index.js"  after

  Each configured path is now classified before use. A package name (`zod`, `@acme/schemas`) is
  left exactly as written. A path already relative keeps its own spelling and only has its
  extension corrected, so anyone who followed the older guidance and wrote
  `../validators/zod/index.js` is unaffected. Anything else is treated as project-relative and
  rewritten against the directory of the file doing the importing.

  Whether a path names a file or a directory is asked of the filesystem, because
  `src/db/connection` and `src/validators/zod` are indistinguishable as strings and are usually a
  file and a directory holding a barrel. A directory gains `/index`. Where nothing exists yet,
  which happens when one generator runs before the one that writes its target, an extensionless
  path is taken to be a directory, since these options name directories by convention and the only
  path that can legitimately be missing is a generated barrel.

  Since a non-relative value could only ever have produced an import that resolved to nothing,
  rewriting it cannot break a setup that worked.

  Exposed by `resolveConfiguredImport` in `@drzl/validation-core`, so all three call sites share
  one rule.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6903012: **Breaking:** every relative specifier DRZL generates now ends in `.js`, so the generated
  tree compiles under `moduleResolution: node16` and `nodenext`.

  ### What you will see

  Regenerate and the specifiers gain an extension. Nothing else about the output changes, and
  no file is renamed:

  ```diff
    // src/validators/zod/index.ts
  - export * from './users.zod';
  + export * from './users.zod.js';

    // src/api/index.ts
  - import { users } from './users';
  + import { users } from './users.js';

    // src/services/userService.ts
  - import type { Insertusers, Updateusers, Selectusers } from './types/users';
  + import type { Insertusers, Updateusers, Selectusers } from './types/users.js';
  ```

  If your build already worked, it still works: `./users.zod.js` resolves to `users.zod.ts`
  under `bundler` and `node10` exactly as the extensionless form did, and it is what Vite,
  esbuild, Rollup, Bun, Vitest and Next.js expect. It will show up in your next diff, and it
  is a good idea to regenerate in one commit of its own.

  ### Why

  Generated files land in your own source tree, so your `tsconfig.json` decides which
  specifiers resolve. Measured against tsc 5.9.2 and 7.0.2, for a specifier naming a sibling
  `.ts` file:

  | specifier        | `bundler` | `node10` | `node16`/`nodenext`, CommonJS | `node16`/`nodenext`, ESM |
  | ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
  | `./users.zod.js` | resolves  | resolves | resolves                      | resolves                 |
  | `./users.zod`    | resolves  | resolves | resolves                      | **does not resolve**     |

  The extensionless form DRZL emitted before this release cannot be imported from an ES module
  under `node16` or `nodenext`. `tsc` reports `TS2307: Cannot find module './users.zod'` on the
  barrel and the build stops, and that was true of the default `fileSuffix`, not only of custom
  ones. That combination is now the common one: `tsc --init` has emitted `"module": "nodenext"`
  since TypeScript 5.9, every `@tsconfig/node*` base sets `"moduleResolution": "node16"`, and
  TypeScript 7 removed `node10` altogether, leaving `bundler`, `node16` and `nodenext` as the
  only three settings that exist.

  ### If `.js` is wrong for you

  Set `importExtension`, at the top level for every generator or on a single generator to
  override it:

  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    schema: 'src/db/schema.ts',
    importExtension: 'none', // 'js' (default) | 'none' | 'ts'
    generators: [{ kind: 'zod', path: 'src/validators/zod' }],
  });
  ```

  - `'none'` restores the pre-2.0 output byte for byte. Use it if your pipeline cannot map
    `.js` back to `.ts`: webpack without `resolve.extensionAlias`, or Jest with `ts-jest` and
    no `moduleNameMapper`.
  - `'ts'` emits `./users.zod.ts`, which needs `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true`. It is the
    only form Node's own type stripping accepts, so it suits running the generated `.ts`
    unbuilt.

  `importExtension` only touches specifiers DRZL invents. Paths you write yourself are still
  emitted verbatim, so on `node16`/`nodenext` in an ES module an `orpc` generator's
  `validation.importPath` has to name the barrel file rather than its directory
  (`'../validators/zod/index.js'`, not `'../validators/zod'`), and the `service` generator's
  `dbImportPath` and `schemaImportPath` need their own `.js`.

  `@drzl/validation-core` exports `ImportExtension`, `DEFAULT_IMPORT_EXTENSION`,
  `IMPORT_EXTENSIONS` and `importSpecifier`, and `moduleSpecifier` takes the extension as a
  third argument, so the five generators cannot disagree about how a module is spelled.
  `@drzl/generator-service` gains a dependency on `@drzl/validation-core` for that reason.

### Minor Changes

- 2f9214e: Add `affix`, so generated identifiers are not stuck on `Insert<Table>Schema`.

  Resolves #16. Set `affix` on a `zod`, `valibot` or `arktype` generator to choose
  the prefix and suffix of the exported schema constants and of the type aliases,
  separately, and either as one string for all three modes or per mode:

  ```ts
  {
    kind: 'zod',
    path: 'src/validators/zod',
    affix: {
      tableCase: 'pascal',
      schema: { suffix: 'Schema' },
      type: {
        prefix: { insert: 'Create', update: 'Edit', select: '' },
        suffix: { insert: 'Input', update: 'Input', select: '' },
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  which emits `InsertUsersSchema`, `CreateUsersInput`, `EditUsersInput` and a bare
  `Users` instead of `InsertusersSchema` and `SelectusersOutput`.

  `tableCase` addresses the second half of that issue. Generated identifiers
  interpolate the Drizzle export name exactly as written, so a table exported as
  `users` produces `Insertusers`. `tableCase: 'pascal'` upper-camels it first,
  splitting on `_`, `-` and camel boundaries, so `user_profiles` and `userProfiles`
  both give `InsertUserProfilesSchema`. The default is `preserve`, which keeps the
  existing behaviour; changing the default is a major-version decision.

  Naming now comes from one resolver in `@drzl/validation-core`
  (`resolveAffix`, `schemaName`, `typeName`, `validateAffix`, `pascalCase`) instead of
  template literals repeated in four packages, which is what lets both sides of an
  import agree. When an `orpc` generator uses `validation.useShared` and exactly one
  sibling generator produces that library, the sibling's `affix` is copied onto it,
  so the router imports the names the validation generator actually exported.
  A `validation.affix` that is set explicitly and disagrees with that sibling now
  fails the run, listing both sets of names, rather than writing a router that does
  not compile.

  Configs are checked before anything is written: an affix that could not appear in
  a TypeScript identifier, or that would put two same-named exports in one file, is
  rejected with the path to the offending option.

  Nothing changes for existing configs. Omitting `affix` reproduces the previous
  output byte for byte, `schemaSuffix` still works and is the default for
  `affix.schema.suffix`, and affixes rename identifiers only, never files or module
  specifiers.

- 6034a24: Make the generated barrel follow `fileSuffix` instead of the default suffix.

  The zod, valibot and arktype generators named each emitted file from `fileSuffix` but wrote
  the barrel with the default suffix hardcoded, so any custom value produced an `index.ts`
  full of imports that pointed at nothing:

  ```ts
  // drzl.config.ts
  { kind: 'zod', path: 'src/validators/zod', fileSuffix: '.schema.ts' }
  ```

  ```ts
  // src/validators/zod/index.ts, next to users.schema.ts and posts.schema.ts
  export * from './users.zod'; // TS2307: Cannot find module './users.zod'
  export * from './posts.zod';
  ```

  The consumer's build failed on the unresolved imports, and so did anything importing the
  barrel, including an `orpc` generator pointed at it through `validation.importPath`. The
  only `fileSuffix` that worked was the default one. Both halves now come from the same
  value, so the barrel renames along with the files.

  Suffixes that are not simply `.<name>.ts` are handled too. A suffix with no leading dot
  runs straight onto the table name (`Schema.ts` gives `usersSchema.ts` and
  `./usersSchema.js`), a suffix that is only an extension leaves the bare table name (`.ts`
  gives `users.ts` and `./users.js`), and `.mts` and `.cts` are written as `.mjs` and `.cjs`,
  which is the only form TypeScript resolves for them.

  Leaving `fileSuffix` unset no longer reproduces the pre-2.0 barrel byte for byte, but that
  is down to the separate `importExtension` change in this same release, which puts a `.js` on
  every specifier DRZL generates. Set `importExtension: 'none'` and the default output is what
  it always was.

  `@drzl/validation-core` exports the two helpers the generators share, `moduleFileName` and
  `moduleSpecifier`, so the file name and the import specifier cannot drift apart again.
